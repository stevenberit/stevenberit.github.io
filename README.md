European Energy Transition: Renewable and Moving Away from Russian Infuence by Steven Berit

All data used in the project was found from eurostat which is ran by the European Union governemnt.

In 2014, Russia invaded the soveign nation of Ukraine annexing part of their land. In 2022, Russia followed up with another invasion of Ukraine starting an all out war. It is widely suspected that Rusia felt able to invade Ukraine due to their influence over Europe. This 'suspected' influence is a result from a European reliance on Russian oil, gas, and coal for energy supplies. European reliance on Russia for energy is a major concnern for many European nation. Another large concern for Europeans is the growing threat of the cliamte emergency. It is my hypothesis that if European nations begin increasing their transiiton to clean energy then they will be less reliant on Russian energy helping eliminate two of their threats. This is what I set out to find out in my data analysis.

I started off by inputting the data from eurostat from 4 separate datasheets. One for EU imports of oil, one for natural gas, one for solid fossil fuels like coal, and one sheet which shows what % of EU energy supplies is from renenwable sources. After cleaning out the data for irrelvant information, I combined the datasets together into one. I then removed any non-EU nation. I then converted each of the fuel datasets into a common unit of measuerment, British Thermal Units which is a common unti of measurement for energy sources. I then added up each of the energy sources into a total column for each nation for each year.

My first analysis was to compare how much of each type of energy source as changed in the amount of imports into the EU from Russia throughout the 2010s. This was to help later in determining if certain energy sources are having a greater influence on EU nations than others and remvoign a reliance on them could help decrease Russian influence in the EU. Based on this analysis, natural gas is having the most signifigant imapct on the EU in recent years, but we will see how that compares to an OLS regression later on. 

Next I created a dual Y-axis line graph for each country to compaare the amount of Russian energy they import to the amount of renewable enrgy they use. Based on the many of the graphs, including many the overall EU graph, as % of energy in renewables increased, reliance on Russian imports decreased.

Next, I ran an OLS regression to determine the imapct that oil, natural gas, and solid fossil fuel imports had on amount of renewable energy being used. Renewabke energy caused a decrease in all 3 tyoes of energy sources being imported and each with a p value of less than 0.05. However, the source that had the greatest decrease from renewable energy being used was oil. 

Finally, I showed thorgh an OLS regression that switching to renewable energy decreased total imports of Russian energy by over 10,000,000 BTU with a p value of 0.

In conclusion, the EU should priortize switiching to renewable energy to prevent Russian influence and help in the fight against the cliamte emergency.
